To run the api, you will need node installed. After that, cd into the top level
backend folder and run "npm install". This will install all of the dependencies
specified in package.json. Next, run "npm start" to launch the api. You should
see a message that says "Server is running on port 3001." then you can go to
localhost:3001 in a browser or localhost:3001/<some endpoint> to interact with
the api directly, or make requests from a tool like postman.
