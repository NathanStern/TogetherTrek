                    Travelling alone while abroad is fairly standard, but it can be unsafe to do so. Because of this, many solo travellers have taken to finding people to travel with wherever they may be in their journey. TogetherTrek makes this process easy by offering users ways to match with like-minded individuals in a safe and secure way. This is done through creating and sharing travel itineraries or finding others using the service near you. While there are many other services that allow users to find travel partners, like Gaffl, TogetherTrek is one of, if not the only, one that offers real-time safety features, trip budgeting, and groups of more than just 2 people.
